Towers of Hanoi Whiteboard

We need a board, make the box droppable
revert when invalid and not in droppable area
we need rings- make them draggable
We need the ability to move rings to another stack.
We need to check for win.


Rule:
rules: no bigger block can be placed over smaller block
//top block
$(ui.draggable).data('block') --> '25'

rules: one block at a time
rules: can only pick up top block***** (extra credit)

determining win: when drop area 3 (data-stack3) has 4 blocks in them, ..child() === 4

declare winner!!

clear Board

keep count of how many moves there are
